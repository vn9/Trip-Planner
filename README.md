### Vina Nguyen
I am a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and I expect to graduate in 2019. Currently I am a lab monitor at the College of Liberal Arts and an undergraduate research assistant at the department of Computer Science. During my free time, I enjoy hiking, listening to music and watching anime. After graduation, I plan to continue my education by becoming a graduate student at Colorado State University.

### Kira Deming
I am a first-year masters student in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship (FRS) where my research focuses on forest planning software and optimization. In addition, I work with FRS and The Colorado Forest Restoration Institute as a GIS Analyst.  When I'm not working, I enjoy running and being outdoors.  I earned my BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State University in 2018.

### Abel Ykalo
I am a third-year computer science student who is planning to graduate in the spring of 2020. I work as a student web developer for the Collaborative for Student Achievement at Colorado State University. I am president fo the Soceity of Black Engineers and Scientists (NSBE) at Colorado State and enjoy playing video games and solving puzzles of any type when time permits. 

### Zhe Liu
I am a fourth-year student with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I chose computer science because I like all kinds of video games and computer science can let me know how those amazing games be produced. Additionally, artifical intelligence (AI) is one of the thing attracts me so I might study AI in my master program. Also, I am looking for a computer science lab where I can be an assistant so that I can connect my knowledge from books with practice. 

# Manifesto
In a team there will be many perspectives about a problem. If each person tries to talk and does not listen to each other's words, the problem will get worse and the team will collapse. Therefore, listening to each other is a key for a successful team. We also think listening to each other shows respect to the team member and gives us the opportunity to learn something new. 

Our team also values hard work and effort.  We understand that everyone has a unique skillset to bring to the team and that this will influence what their contributions look like.  That is okay, all we ask is that everyone puts forth their best work and effort.  By working together as  a team we can create things that we never could on our own, but that must start with everyone's individual efforts.  If the initial work is not there, there is nothing we can work with.  

# Expectations
The first expectation our team has is that every member will not procrastinate. It is always good to start early. If we do not know how to solve a problem while working individually, we still have other members who can help us. Then we will have the results we want. If one of us procrastinates, it will affect each others' progress and we will not have the assisnments completed on time. 

The second expectation of our team is that constructive feedback will be given.  This means that if someone asks for a review, it will be done. This expectation does not imply that all feedback will be positive, but that feedback will be provided in a way that will help guide the work toward the desired end product.  This means giving helpful suggestions for improvement, rather than just asking someone to redo their work.  It is also answering questions and pointing others in the right direction.
