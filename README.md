### Vina Nguyen
I am a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and I expect to graduate in 2019. Currently I am a lab monitor at the College of Liberal Arts and an undergraduate research assistant at the department of Computer Science. During my free time, I enjoy hiking, listening to music and watching anime. After graduation, I plan to continue my education by becoming a graduate student at Colorado State University.

### Kira Deming
I am a first-year masters student in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship (FRS) where my research focuses on forest planning software and optimization. In addition, I work with FRS and The Colorado Forest Restoration Institute as a GIS Analyst.  When I'm not working, I enjoy running and being outdoors.  I earned my BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State University in 2018.

### Abel Ykalo

I work as a student web developer for the Collaborative for Student Achievement at Colorado State University. I am president fo the Soceity of Black Engineers and Scientists (NSBE) at Colorado State and enjoy playing video games and solving puzzles of any type when time permits. 


# Manifesto
In a team there will be many perspectives about a problem. If each person tries to talk and does not listen to each other's words, the problem will get worse and the team will collapse. Therefore, listening to each other is a key for a successful team. We also think listening to each other shows respect to the team member and gives us the opportunity to learn something new. 

Our team also values hard work and effort.  We understand that everyone has a unique skillset to bring to the team and that this will influence what their contributions look like.  That is okay, all we ask is that everyone puts forth their best work and effort.  By working together as  a team we can create things that we never could on our own, but that must start with everyone's individual efforts.  If the initial work is not there, there is nothing we can work with.

Another value our team has is consistent work. We believe working for 6 hours over 3 days on a project is better than working for 7 hours in a single day. Making incremental work over the course of the week will lead to better quaity of work. Therefore instead of trying to complete all our work in one sitting we try to get a decent amount of the work done every day. Our project will always be fresh in our minds and we will not suffer from fatigue if we work in this manner. 

# Expectations
The first expectation our team has is that every member will not procrastinate. It is always good to start early. If we do not know how to solve a problem while working individually, we still have other members who can help us. Then we will have the results we want. If one of us procrastinates, it will affect each others' progress and we will not have the assisnments completed on time. 

The second expectation of our team is that constructive feedback will be given.  This means that if someone asks for a review, it will be done. This expectation does not imply that all feedback will be positive, but that feedback will be provided in a way that will help guide the work toward the desired end product.  This means giving helpful suggestions for improvement, rather than just asking someone to redo their work.  It is also answering questions and pointing others in the right direction.

The third expection our team will have is good communication. We will alert our teammates of emergencies and absences from class. Good communication also includes informing the group when one member feels they need assistance on a task. Checking up on group members that are starting to fall behind in work and having a conversation with them on how to improve their work is also an expectation that derives from communication. Good communication will lead to less disagreements and will solve our problems in a timely manner.

Last but not least, we expect eveyone in the team to follow some steps to work with gitHub. First of all, we will create new issue stating the problem we are trying to resolve and how we will approach it. Then, we will make the changes in the files and ask for a pull request. If the changes we made are important we will let other team members know and have at least two people review the changes. Otherwise, we will need only one reviewer so we do not have to wait to do the next step. After reviewing we will comment with further changes or approve that pull request. Finally, we agree that the last person who reviews the pull request will merge the branch to the master to prevent bias.
