# Sprint 4 - *t04* - *Rush Hour*

## Goal

### Interactive Maps and Shorter Trips!
### Sprint Leader: *firstname lastname*

## Definition of Done

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint4.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing as server-4.0.jar on the production server.
* Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Epics and Tasks updated in Zenhub.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order for all methods/functions.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is at least 50%, 70% preferred.
#### Clean Code
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery
* Travis successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 
* All pull requests are deployed on the development server.
* The development server is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.


## Plan

*This sprint we plan to accomplish two epics "All code shall be clean!" and "All code must be tested" from last sprint. Additionally, we are going to add 3-opt algorithm as another optimization option to get the shortest trips possible. Also we plan to allow users to plan their trips worldwide as well as use other tools to view the trip. Last but not least, we plan to modify our codes such that it will allow the trip to plan as fast as possible.*

*Include any design diagrams prepared during sprint planning (user interface, component diagram, component/state/hierarchy, etc.) with a short paragraph for each.

Epics planned for this sprint.
