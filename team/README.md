### Kira Deming
I am a first-year masters student in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship (FRS) where my research focuses on forest planning software and optimization. In addition, I work with FRS and The Colorado Forest Restoration Institute as a GIS Analyst.  When I'm not working, I enjoy running and being outdoors.  I earned my BS in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State University in 2018.
