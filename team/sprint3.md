# Sprint 3 - *t04* - *Rush Hour*

## Goal

### The goal of this sprint is to add features to our application that include, allowing the user to create a plan from start for their trip, and also to complete the epics that were left over from sprint 2.
### Sprint Leader: *Junyi Liu*

## Definition of Done

* Search database is up and is usuable to make a new trip from start
* All epics from sprint 2 are resolved and closed
* Test Coverage reaches 70%
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint3.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing as server-3.0.jar.
* Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Epics and Tasks updated in Zenhub.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order for all methods/functions.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is at least 50%, 70% preferred.
#### Clean Code
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Two approved reviews, second review merges the request.
* Branch that is being pulled MUST be tested on own computer before any approval.
#### Continuous Integration
* Travis successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

*This sprint we plan to accomplish all of the previous sprint's epics as well as allowing the user to search through our database to add destinations to their plans. We also want to add opt1 as an optimization option where we use the nearest neighbor algorithm.*

*We have two images in our slack channel that depicts what we would like our interface to look like and is our outline for the entire sprint*

Epics planned for this sprint.

* *#205: All code must be tested*
* *#123: I want to supply my own units for the distances: App supports any units defined by the user for distance calculations.*
* *#125: TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices: App is designed for mobile environment and still looks good on desktop.*
* *#206: TripCo: I want to design a trip from scratch so I can stop using my other tool*
* *#203: TripCo: I want to make to make and save changes to my trip*


## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | *8* | *7* |
| Tasks |  *16*   | *37* | 
| Story Points |  *31*  | *67* | 

*In this sprint we had a large gap in the number of story points and tasks that we planned and that we ended up completing.  One of our stuggles has been planning at the beginning and really thinking every single epic through.  We ended up with more tasks and points because each task and epic we planned to completed needed to be split further than we had anticipated.*

## Review

*This sprint we ended with an application that allows the user to build a trip from scratch, calculate the distance between two points, and shorten their trip.  When building a trip from scratch, the user can add places via file upload, manual input, or search our database for possible locations to add.  They may also reverse their trip, save it, and change their starting location.  They can choose between three levels of optimization for the trip length (none, short, and shorter).  The units and optimization displays now show the user what unit they are currently using and what level of optimization. The layout has also been revamped!*

#### Completed Epics in Sprint Backlog 

*Describe the solution based on the completed epics and list the epics below.*

* *## epic title: comments*
* 

#### Incomplete Epics in Sprint Backlog 

*Describe capabilities not included in the release and list the epics below with an explanation.*

* *#124 All Code Shall Be Clean: All the code is not as clean as it could be.  There are some blocks of code that we simply haven't figured out a better way to write.*
*  *#205 All Code Must Be Tested: All the code is not tested, partciularly the client code.  Testing the client turned out to be much harder than we thought it would be.*
* *Both of the above-mentioned epics were difficult to keep up with, particularly as we rushed to catch back up.*

#### What Went Well

*Describe what went well during the sprint in general terms followed by a more detailed list.*

* *We did a very good job of hitting the ground running. Our burndown chart was ideal following the ideal path that was drawn for us. We also had better group participation throughout by specific members.*
*

#### Problems Encountered and Resolutions

*Describe what problems occurred during the sprint in general terms followed by a more detailed list.*

* *Partway through our sprint we had a rut where no story points were completed for multiple days. We were lost as a team and had difficulty getting back to our productive start. We got together, regrouped, and were able to finish strong in the last three days.*
* *Open Pull Requests:* This sprint we had a problem where pull requests would build up.  We solved this problem by letting others know when things would be going up and specifically asking for people to look them over.*

## Retrospective

*An introductory paragraph for your retrospective.*

#### What we changed this sprint

*In our last sprint we decided that we would work on improving our communciation.  This sprint we made a point of asking others for updates as well as updating the group. We frequently asked each other about progress and what we could do next.*

#### What we did well

*We started the sprint off very productively and had a great pace throughout the first half of the sprint. We also did a better job of managing tasks and being on the same page with what everyone was doing at all times.  This sprint, dependencies were finished in a timely manner, which helped us continually move forward.*

#### What we need to work on

*Articulate things you could improve at the end of the sprint.*

#### What we will change next sprint 

*Articulate the one thing you will change for the next sprint and how you will accomplish that.*
