### Sprint Leader: *Junyi Liu*

## Definition of Done

* Search database is up and is usuable to make a new trip from start
* All epics from sprint 2 are resolved and closed
* Test Coverage reaches 70%
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint3.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing as server-3.0.jar.
* Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Epics and Tasks updated in Zenhub.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order for all methods/functions.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is at least 50%, 70% preferred.
#### Clean Code
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Two approved reviews, second review merges the request.
* Branch that is being pulled MUST be tested on own computer before any approval.
#### Continuous Integration
* Travis successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.

## Plan

*This sprint we plan to accomplish all of the previous sprint's epics as well as allowing the user to search through our database to add destinations to their plans. We also want to add opt1 as an optimization option where we use the nearest neighbor algorithm. *

*We have two images in our slack channel that depicts what we would like our interface to look like and is our outline for the entire sprint*

Epics planned for this sprint.

* *#205: All code must be tested*
* *#123: I want to supply my own units for the distances: App supports any units defined by the user for distance calculations.*
* *#125: TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices: App is designed for mobile environment and still looks good on desktop.*
* *#206: TripCo: I want to design a trip from scratch so I can stop using my other tool*
* *#203: TripCo: I want to make to make and save changes to my trip*
