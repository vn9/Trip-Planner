# Sprint 1 - *04* - *Rush Hour*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Abel Ykalo*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint1.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* Personalized the user interface with team name, number, and unit buttons.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master.
* At least one approving review before merging code.
* Post messages in Slack, not group chat.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *RESTful Service for distance*
* *Responsive Client for distance calculator*

Planning Decisions Made

* Set weekly group meeting
* Assigned task difficulty values
* Distributed tasks in an equitable manner
* Added two other face-to-face group meetings


## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *RESTful Service for distance:  *Vina oversaw this portion and we had few, if any, issues*
* *Responsive Client for distance calculator:  *Our most difficult task.  A complete team effort.  LZ worked hard and got our server and deployment running. Abel and Kira handled the creation and revision of the calculate and distance classes, while Vina made sure all the units being calculated were supported.*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *None*

#### What went well
* Everyone was very accomdating when it came to arranging extra meeting times.
* Debugging as a team was very efficient. 
* People were responsive in the Slack channel when teammates had questions.
* We completed all the tasks given to us. 

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Problem 1:* In the beginning, we did not understand what to do and how our parts would interact.  In order to resolve the problem we sat down as a group and talked ourselves through it.  What we couldn't answer we asked the TA about.  
* *Problem 2:* When the server deployment test was due at midnight our deployments failed, worked, and failed again.  To get it working, our group messaged back and forth to figure out had who deployed at what time and what they deployed.  Then redeployed the working solution. 
* *Problem 3:*  After all the other code came together, our code wouldn't return the correct numbers.  In order to fix the problem our group met up in the computer lab to suggest and test solutions.  

## Retrospective

#### What went well
We were very flexible with being able to meet on short notice and code next to each other. We also were very responsive on Github and Slack with reviewing each other's work. We found that we worked most efficently when we all sat down and coded next to each other. Pull requests were fulfilled quickly and debugging was a team effort instead of individual's burden. 

#### Potential improvements
A potential improvement is to implement incremental deadlines within our sprints so that we are communicating our issues and successes ahead of time, which will result in less of a time crunch at the end and better communcication throughout the sprint. We could also improve by making the time estimations and task assignments more of a group effort instead of individually estimating them after they have been assigned.  As a team, we also felt that we could improve our communication about what is available on Piazza, particularly if it could help others with their task.  

#### What we will change next time
We will come together at the beginning of the sprint to create estimates for tasks together and assign tasks at the earliest time possible. In addition, having an early meeting will help reduce confusion about the assignment and the individual tasks. We will also test our product earlier and more frequently now that we all have a better grasp on how to test our code.
