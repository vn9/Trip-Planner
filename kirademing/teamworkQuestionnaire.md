# Teamwork Questionnaire for Kira Deming

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__
   * Text is best.  Feel free to message anytime between 7am-11pm. I may be at work or out exercising without my phone, but I will get back to you as soon as I can!
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__
   * I expect my team to accomplish more and do better than we thought we could at the start of the semester.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__
   * I would like to be more confident in expressing when something doesn't make sense to me or when I am unsure of the direction of the team.  
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__
   * I will be tempted to hold back my opinions and thoughts as I feel like I am the least experienced person on the team and that others will know better than I do the majority of the time.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__
   * I think that everyone should try to help others achieve their goals, so I'd expect everyone to put forth their best effort.  
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__
   * I think it should be within reason. Everyone should put forth their best effort and if someone wants to enhance it, they should ask if it's okay.  I don't believe in someone overhauling the end product to mold it to their own ideal.  
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__
   * Personally, I will be putting in a lot of hours because I am not the best when it comes to coding, but I would like to do well.  
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__
   * Decide as a group.  When in doubt, draw straws.  
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__
   * I would be pretty frustrated.  I think it would depend on what they missed.  It'd be a case by case kind of thing.  I would expect them to take responsibility though.  
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__
   * They should talk about where they disagree, why, and try to find an acceptable middle ground solution as well as what they expect on future work.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__
   * I will try to be accommodating, but expect that what we agree upon will be upheld.  
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__
   * Yes, it worked out really well on my last semester-long project.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__
   * Unknown at this time.  I think it really depends.  
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__
   * Within reason and depending on the situation. Small things I think you don't need everyone's approval, but larger things I would think you'd want to have at least 3/4 people review what you intend to do.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__
   * I'll try to understand why they disagree and see if there is an acceptable solution, even if it's not what they believe is the best course of action.  If one person is consistently the odd person out, I'd definitely move to address that issue pretty quickly.  It's no fun to feel like everyone is teamed up against you.    
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
   * Intentionally work to ask others what they think of something to encourage more even participation.  
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__
   * Roll with it, but actively create space and opportunities for others to be more involved.
